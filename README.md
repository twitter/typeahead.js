[typeahead.js][gh-page]
=======================

Inspired by [twitter.com]'s autocomplete search functionality, typeahead.js is 
a flexible JavaScript library that provides a strong foundation for building 
robust typeaheads.

The typeahead.js library consists of 2 components: the suggestion engine, 
[Bloodhound], and the UI view, [Typeahead]. 
The suggestion engine is responsible for computing suggestions for a given 
query. The UI view is responsible for rendering suggestions and handling DOM 
interactions. Both components can be used separately, but when used together, 
they can provide a rich typeahead experience.
